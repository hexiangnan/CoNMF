The codes (written in Python) are the implementation of CoNMF proposed in [1]. The codes are only for academic use, e.g. reproducing the experimental results, further research, comparasion and so on. Please do not distribute the codes for any commerical use.

If using the codes, please cite the paper:

[1] Xiangnan He, Min-Yen Kan, Peichu Xie, Xiao Chen. Comment-based Multi-View Clustering of Web 2.0 Items. In Proc. of the 23rd international conference on World Wide Web (WWW '14), Seoul, South Korea, April 7-11, 2014, pp 771 - 782. 

----------------------------------
Steps to make the code run:

1. Install Python 2.7 (tested in 2.7.5)
2. Install numpy, scipy (http://www.scipy.org/)
3. Install sklean (http://scikit-learn.org/)
4. Install Munkres (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres/)
5. Run main.py, you can get the main experimental results (Table 5 in [1]).

The above set-up steps are tested in Windows 7 and Mac OS.

If you have any issues in running the codes, feel free to contact the author Xiangnan He (xiangnanhe@gmail.com).
